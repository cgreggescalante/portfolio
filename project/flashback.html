The data used for this project was obtained through Spotify&#x27;s &quot;Download your data&quot; feature, specifically the Extended Streaming History download. You can request a copy of your own data by navigating to the Spotify website, opening the Account Overview, and going to Privacy Settings.</p><p class="card-text">After requesting my data, it took nearly a month for it to become available for download. I suppose this wait is quite reasonable, considering some of the data was nealy 4 years old, and likely no longer used by their recommendation engine. Spotify provides the data in JSON form, split so that each file contains about 15 to 16 thousand plays. A single play being a record of the user starting a track, listening for any amount of time, then ending it. My data was nearly 128 thousand plays over the last 4 years.</p><p class="card-text">My next step was to organize this data into a more usable form. I briefly considered only storing the data in a local SQLite database, and just serving static charts and tables through GitHub. This would have quickly become bloated if I wanted to view history for individual tracks or artists. My next option was MongoDB, which I had some experience using in a certification course. I pushed ahead with that option, until I found that the drivers for MongoDB don&#x27;t allow access from the client. Rats. After some research, I settled on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which ended up being a great option.</p><p class="card-text">Oracle offers a large amount of free hosting resources, including a variety of database options. I chose to use their Autonomous Database solution, which makes it very easy to create and manage a database. It even includes a simple interface for creating a REST API that translates http calls directly into SQL queries.</p></div></div></main></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/project/flashback","query":{},"buildId":"etlv1G2NpwmzLAJKojcmG","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
